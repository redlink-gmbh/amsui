# Result entry component

This components delivers a Angular Material card, that is filled by the type `ResultEntry`.
An `<em>`-HTML tag is needed to achieve highlighting of results. Whatever is inside an `<em>` tag will be highlighted.
Without setting a result, an empty card is displayed.

Due to the fact that the classList changed via JS, an adaption of a text in Storybook will remove the highlighting of the text.
Since this is only a showcase library, the priority to change it isn't too high because the process works very well in practical applications.

## Default

Just add a title and a description and the result entry looks like this.

<Story story={stories.Default} height="200px" />

## Deactivated highlighting

<Story story={stories.DeactivateHighlighting} height="200px" />

## Add an Material avatar icon to distinguish between results

<Story story={stories.AvatarIconResult} height="200px" />

## Add an avatar image to distinguish between results

<Story story={stories.AvatarImageResult} height="200px" />

## Add an image to the main text of the result

<Story story={stories.WithImage} height="600px" />

## Meta information of the result entry

<Story story={stories.WithMetaInfo} height="250px" />

## Tags about the results

<Story story={stories.WithTags} height="250px" />

## Add actions to the result entry

<Story story={stories.WithActions} height="250px" />

## Show more behavior of description of an entry

<Story story={stories.ShowMoreDescription} height="450px" />

## Show more limit can also be set

The default value is at about 100 visible words. Of course, this is dependent on the size of the words in a description,
but can give you a rough estimation about the size of a result entry.

<Story story={stories.ShowMoreLimit} height="450px" />

## Using all features of the result entry component

<Story story={stories.AllFeatures} height="700px" />

## Change the text of the component

<Story story={stories.ChangeText} height="450px" />

## ArgsTable

Only the inputs and outputs are important when using this component in a different application.

If you contributing to the library, the description of the different methods, properties, etc. could help your understanding.

<ArgsTable of={ResultEntryComponent} />
