# Facet component

This component enables a faceted search. A lot of different options can be applied to the facet-

## Default Facet

The facet looks like this if no configuration is applied.

<Story story={stories.Default} height="450px" />

## Show More Threshold Facet

You can set the threshold of how much facets should be shown at initialisation.

<Story story={stories.ShowMoreThreshold} height="450px" />

## No show more Facet

Of course, you can deactive the show more button at all. Just makes all options visible.

<Story story={stories.NoShowMore} height="450px" />

## Search facet

If many facet options are available, a search can be included.

<Story story={stories.Search} height="450px" />

## Collapsed facet

The initial state of a facet is open, but you can change that too.

<Story story={stories.Collapsed} height="450px" />

## Icon facet

To have a more visual attractive facet, you could a material icon.

<Story story={stories.Icon} height="450px" />

## Multiselect facet

If you want to select multiple facets, you could do it by setting the `facetType` to "multi".

<Story story={stories.MultiSelect} height="450px" />

## ArgsTable

Only the inputs and outputs are important when using this component in a different application.

If you contributing to the library, the description of the different methods, properties, etc. could help your understanding.

<ArgsTable of={FacetComponent} />
