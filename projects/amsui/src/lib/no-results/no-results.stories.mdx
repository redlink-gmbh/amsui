# No results component

It is important to have an no results page, otherwise your users will hit a dead end an leave your site.
So we decided to make a no results component with some helpful features for the users.

## Default values

The no results page looks like this if no configuration is applied.

<Story story={stories.Default} height="300px" />

## No results with contact information

Added contact information.

<Story story={stories.ContactInformation} height="550px" />

## Keyword handling and useful keyword actions

A did you mean could be added if given from the outside. Also the current keyword is highlighted.
This focuses the user to check the spelling of it.
Alternative keywords can also be added.

<Story story={stories.KeywordHandling} height="500px" />

## Alternative results

Display alternative results on the no results page.

<Story story={stories.AlternativeResults} height="550px" />

## No results page with all its abilities

<Story story={stories.AllFeatures} height="1000px" />

## ArgsTable

Only the inputs and outputs are important when using this component in a different application.

If you contributing to the library, the description of the different methods, properties, etc. could help your understanding.

<ArgsTable of={NoResultsComponent} />
