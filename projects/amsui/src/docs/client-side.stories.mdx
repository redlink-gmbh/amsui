# Client-side usage setup

You need to have Angular Material library imported in your Angular project.

```
ng add @angular/material
```

Install the AMSUI library.

```
npm i @redlink/amsui -S
```

## i18n - @ngx-translate

We use [@ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core) and a [modular loader](https://github.com/larscom/ngx-translate-module-loader) for supporting multiple languages.
Add language translation files in the i18n directory to your assets folder.

```
npm i @ngx-translate/core @larscom/ngx-translate-module-loader -S
```

Add the following factory function before the module configuration of your app.module.ts.
Adjust the `baseTranslateUrl` according to the path of your translation files.
Important here is the order of the entries in the modules.
Always have the library translations first to be able to override them.

```
export function moduleHttpLoaderFactory(http: HttpClient): ModuleTranslateLoader {
  const baseTranslateUrl = './assets/i18n';

  const options: IModuleTranslationOptions = {
    modules: [
      { baseTranslateUrl: baseTranslateUrl + '/amsui' },
      { baseTranslateUrl },
    ],
  };

  return new ModuleTranslateLoader(http, options);
}
```

Import the TranslateModule into the AppModule with the following configuration.
The HttpClientModule also needs to be imported.

```
TranslateModule.forRoot({
  loader: {
    provide: TranslateLoader,
    useFactory: moduleHttpLoaderFactory,
    deps: [HttpClient],
  },
}),
```

Add this to the assets settings of your angular.json file in your application specific configurations,
so that your Angular application knows where to find the library-specific translations.

```
{
  "glob": "**/*",
  "input": "./node_modules/@redlink/amsui/translations/",
  "output": "./assets/i18n/amsui/"
}
```

You can easily override every text of the library by just adding the translation key of the text you want to override to your application's translations files.
You can find the translation key values in the node modules directory of the AMSUI library.

Last thing that you need to do is to set the default languages when starting up the application (mostly done in the constructor of the app.component.ts):

```
constructor(private readonly translateService: TranslateService) {
  // this language will be used as a fallback when a translation isn't found in the current language
  translateService.setDefaultLang('de');

  // the lang to use, if the lang isn't available, it will use the current loader to get them
  translateService.use('en');
}

```

## Theming & styling

You need to add the global styles of the AMSUI library as well.
Just put the import statement at the top of your global styles files.

```
@import "~@redlink/amsui/styles/styles.scss";
```

Additionally, you can import our predefined library themes or you can just add one by yourself.
This can be done by using a [Material Theme Generator](https://materialtheme.arcsine.dev/).

```
@import "~@redlink/amsui/styles/themes/{theme-name}.theme.scss";
```

### Breakpoints

Furthermore, pre configured breakpoints of the library can be included in your SCSS and TS files as well.
This would lead to a consistent and responsive user interface.

Breakpoints:

- Mobile: '(max-width: 599.98px)'
- Tablet: '(min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 959.98px)'
- Desktop: '(min-width: 960px)'

Import breakpoints into your global style file via SCSS:

```
@import "~@redlink/amsui/styles/breakpoints.scss";
```

Import in TS to be able to use the Angular Breakpoint Observer:

```
import {Breakpoints} from "amsui";
```

## Using it

Now, that you successfully added the library to your Angular application, you can use it.

If you want to add a complete search page to your application or you have a Solr index as a backend,
you should consider using the library via the integrated handler of your search data.
You can find more about it in the [backend integration section](./?path=/story/documentation-backend-integration--page#backend-integration-for-amsui).

If you want to use standalone components, go to the [standalone usage of AMSUI components](./?path=/story/documentation-standalone-usage--page#standalone-usage-of-components).
