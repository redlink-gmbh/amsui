# Getting started

The Angular Material Search UI, in short AMSUI, is build to deliver search UI components that already include all the best practices.
These are needed to guarantee a great search experience for your users.

As the name already stated, the library is an extensions for the Angular Material library.

## Development instructions

The library can be used in the development process in three different scenarios:

1. Maintaining, releasing, developing the library itself
2. Using the library's search service, UI components and the Backend Adapter Service for a MVP-like search application/page.
3. Using some of the UI components standalone from the library.
