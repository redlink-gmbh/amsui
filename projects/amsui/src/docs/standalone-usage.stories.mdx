# Standalone usage of components

Some applications won't build a search user interface from scratch, but they will possible need a new element in their interface.
Therefore, each of the components in the AMSUI library can be used standalone. Just import the modules that you need and you good to go.

## Available Components

Some components are nested, for example, multiple facet components in the facet group, but they can also just used on their own as well.

- search field
- facet group
  - facet
- search result wrapper
  - search results container
  - search result entry
  - no results container
  - search meta information
    - did you mean text
    - result view type toggle
    - meta information text
    - sort dropdown
- overlay loader

You can easily import all of the above component's module and just the ones that you need.
The components have defaults, so they work either out-of-the-box or just don't show up.
They do not create errors when adding the corresponding selector tag without any attributes or event handlers in your application's templates.

Just go to the component you want add on the left sidebar menu. You will get a quick intro about each component there.
