# Backend integration for AMSUI

The library provides two services for handling the data for your AMSUI search and the backend that you use:

1. A **search service** that holds the typed data.
   It enables the easier management of your backend search data and guarantees,
   that you have used the correct types for the input parameters of the AMSUI components.

2. An Apache **Solr service** which can be used for handling standard Solr HTTP Response.
   It supports the transformation of facets, search meta information, filter query, sorting of a response,
   and it takes care of the requests to the Solr endpoint as well.
   The provided Solr Service is just a basis, you can't use it without creating an own service in your application.

## Search service

This search service can hold the main data of your search responses and the reference element of the overlay loader.
Internally, it uses `BehaviourSubjects`to manage the data and it exposes an `Observable` for it to the outer layers.

You can subscribe to these Observables, and your data will change with every new value that is added to the `BehaviourSubjects`.
When using the included Solr Service, the new values will be set on each new request.
Just inject the search service to your components constructor

```
import { SearchService } from '@redlink/amsui';
constructor(private readonly searchService: SearchService) { ... }
```

and access the Observables for the different data.
You could either save them to component-scoped variables or
make the `searchService` accessible (public) in the component's template.

```
ngOnInit(): void {
  this.facets$ = this.searchService.facets$;
  this.results$ = this.searchService.searchResults$;
  this.searchResultMeta$ = this.searchService.searchResultMeta$;
  ...
}
```

Lastly, you can easily add the data Observables to the AMSUI components in your template with Angular's async pipe.

```
<amsui-search-results-wrapper
  [searchResultMeta]="(searchResultMeta$ | async)"
  [searchResults]="(results$ | async)"
  ...
>
  ...
</amsui-search-results-wrapper
```

### Use other backends as data provider

You can also make use of the search service when not using Solr as backend.
Just write your own adapter to your backend, which can set the values for the search service's subject on each new request.
The adapter just extracts the information from the HTTP response and transforms it to the necessary types of the AMSUI library.

## Solr service

First, you need to create a new service which extends Solr service from the AMSUI library.
Then you need to set some protected variables, which is like configuring it to your Solr-specific settings.
These settings are adjustable for now:

- Solr URL
- Filter configuration
- Facet configuration
- Result type configuration
- Sorting configuration
- Overlay loader
- ...

Now, since every Solr Index likely delivers a different Doc type in its response,
you should overwrite the `transformSearchResults` function.
This functions maps your context-specific docs to the `ResultEntry` type, which is used to display search results.

```
transformSearchResults(
  docs: any[],
  highlights: Highlighting
): ResultEntry[];
```

When using a Solr service, you listen to changes inside the AMSUI components.
When an output event is fired, you make a new request to the Solr Index and put in some new input data.

## TODO - Public Solr Index for Demo - BLOCKER

- how to integrate code
- show config for result types
- search field, facet-group and search result wrapper are enough to make a search user interface
