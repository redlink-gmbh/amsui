# Handling of URL params

Adding the current state of the search to the URL parameters currently works for the search field and the facets, but you need to enable/disable it for both separately.
It is enabled by default.

# TODO - Refactoring needed

- adding the current showed results and filter to the url parameters
- make it globally changeable
