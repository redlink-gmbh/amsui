# Handling of URL params

Adding the current state of the search to the URL parameters currently works for the search field and the facets, but you need to enable/disable it for both separately in the corresponding component.
It is enabled by default.

This enables to send links of your website to another persons and they will instantly get the same results as you do.

## Helper methods

Some helper methods are added to be able to add such behaviour in your client applications.

### paramsToSelectedFacets

This takes your URL params and resolves the selected facets from it. You can extract the params via the activated route for instance.

```
paramsToSelectedFacets(params: Params): SelectedFacet[]
```

The type params can have a key as string and any type for the value. Mostly it is a key:value pair with the type string.

```
type Params = {
  [key: string]: any;
};
```

### resetToQueryParam

If the value is not empty, it adds the key:value param to the URL.
If the value is empty, it removes all search params.

```
resetToQueryParam(key: string, value: string): void
```

### paramsNotEmpty

This function checks if your URL params are not empty. It returns either true if your params are containing some values or false if your params are empty.

```
paramsNotEmpty(params: Params): boolean
```

### Example of using it in the ngOnInit if a user comes to our site with a link that contains params

```
this.activatedRoute.queryParams
  .pipe(takeUntil(this.notifierDestroySubs))
  .subscribe((params) => {
    if (paramsNotEmpty(params)) {
      this.searchKeyword = params.q || '';
      if (this.searchKeyword !== '') {
        this.searchService.selectedFacets = paramsToSelectedFacets(params);
        this.publicApiService.search(this.searchKeyword);
      }
    }
  });
```
