# AMSUI - Angular Material Search User Interfaces
This library provides a set of UI elements of search interfaces. 
Each element's recommendations have been researched and the identified best practices from main UX/UI institutions and 
researchers ([Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/), [Baymard Institue](https://baymard.com/), etc.) have taken into account.
Not only theoretical knowledge has been used to develop the library, but also our empirical knowledge in information retrieval and search sector.
The library is developed by the [Redlink GmbH](https://redlink.at) based in Austria. 

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.6 and it depends on a few packages (@angular/material, @ngx-translate/core).
